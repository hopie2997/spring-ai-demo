# Getting Started

### How to boot this application

Step 1: You need to setup an OpenAI API key in the `application.yml` file.
Follow this guide to get an API key from
OpenAI: [Create and export an API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart#create-and-export-an-api-key)

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: spring-ai-demo
  ai:
    openai:
      api-key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

Step 2: Uncomment the code to use the OpenAI API in the `AiChatController.kt` file

```java
        // uncomment the following line to test
        /*

        // Ask anything
        response = simplePrompt(query)

        // Ask about top 10 videos on youtube about a topic, the response is in a structured format
        response = structuredOutput(query)

        // stuffing the prompt with the provided data
        response = simplePromptStuffing(query)
        response = promptStuffingWithSimpleVectorStore(query)
        response = promptStuffingWithPgVectorStore(query)

        // ask the MFV employees list
        response = functionCalling(query)

        * */
```

Step 3: Run docker-compose up

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Step 4: Run the application from the IDE or using the following command

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

Step 5: Open the browser and navigate to the following URL to use: [Demo chat](http://localhost:8080/chat)

```
http://localhost:8080/chat
```
